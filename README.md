# Subject
The objective of this project is to create a dynamic ELF library to replace (to a certain extent) the standardC library you use every day on your system.

Here are the functions to be implemented in your MiniLibC:
* strlen
* strchr
* memset
* memcpy
* strcmp
* memmove
* strncmp
* strcasecmp
* rindex
* strstr
* strpbrk
* strcspn
